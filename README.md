# 2026 AI Conference Year Map

A static web page that visualizes 2026 global AI conferences by **month and category**.

- Cleaned and organized conference data from CSV.
- Designed a dark-themed grid layout for quick scanning of events.
- Deployed on Netlify: https://heroic-cat-ea76c7.netlify.app/

This project is my personal practice for:
- turning research data into a planning tool
- basic HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- deploying a static site for others to use
